# Project O'micro 

## What is O'micro ? 
Made during school, this application is a combination of a cloud storage service and a minimalist studio. You can
create a song where you or other band members can record their ideas. Once recorded, you
can listen to all the instruments together, creating a perfect prototype for a song. It also helps
to save all your band's songs and ideas in a single place. To simplify understanding, we can
divide the application into four parts: the band, the songs, the records, and the studio.

## Backend API
In order to works, you'll need to fork the Laravel backend part of O'micro, along with a SQL database.
